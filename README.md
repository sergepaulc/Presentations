## Machine Learning for Enterprise Finance
Machine learning models have many applications in finance to both improve the bottom and top line of an enterprise. Models can streamline workflows, provide insights, help with decision-making, and increase customer engagement. Multiple models can be implemented together for an end-to-end workflow such as a complete solution to automate accounts payable from data extraction, accounts coding, anomaly detection, to bank reconciliation. More complex models can also be investigated such as recommender systems to provide personalized experiences, reinforcement learning for learning user feedback, and graph neural networks for demand forecasting.

## Exploring Causal Inference for Business Decisions

While A/B testing aims to establish any difference between two randomized groups “A” and “B”, and the causal effect of changing “x” on the outcome “y” on group “A” versus group “B”, causal inference techniques attempt to discover and mitigate the cofounding factors “c” (called also omitted variable bias in statistics) that affect the input of interests “x” with the outcome of interest “y”. Knowing the relationships between “x” and “y” enables to generate actionable insights in order to make the right course of actions to move from "x" to "y".

## How to Learn Faster? Multi-Task and Meta-Learning to the Rescue

One of the key goals of many data scientist teams is to develop models faster for new use cases and new applications. To that end, “transfer learning” which aims to train on one task, and to transfer that learning to a new task has been widely used in particular, in computer vision, and language models. However, two new techniques have emerged recently: “multi-task learning” which aims to train a system on many tasks, and transfer that learning to the system for a new task, and “meta-learning” which empowers a system to learn to learn from many tasks, and transfer that learning to the system for similar tasks.

## Machine Learning for the Internet of Things (IoT)

The Internet of Things (IoT) is all about machine learning at scale. The value of an IoT solution is in its machine learning applications. Those applications are what will motivate the IoT users to be more engaged with their devices. And, the more devices are connected to the IoT platform, the more the machine learning applications will provide value to the users of the IoT devices.

## Cross Platform Mobile Development Tools

Every mobile platform has its own development environment: BlackBerry (Java and C/C++), iOS (Objective C), and Android (Dalvik Java). Fortunately for developers, there are a few alternatives. Some tools can wrap existing HTML into native libraries such as PhoneGap or even generate native code from existing HTML such as Appcelerator.

## IP Security

IDS is dead. Welcome IDP. IPSec is dead. Welcome SSL. Well, history repeats itself. IDS and IDP are two different technologies for two different applications. The same is true for IPSec and SSL. IPSec provides data privacy at the network layer. SSL provides data privacy at the application layer. There will always be the need for an enterprise network to have IPSec and SSL to co-exist like there is for IDS and IDP.

## Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS)

MPLS emerged as a traffic engineering technology to optimize traffic loads on the Internet backbone by distributed loads evenly in the backbone. An ingress system shares its transit load across multiple paths. With more and more functions, features and applications being developed by the IETF and the MPLS forum, MPLS is enabling a new range of applications beyond traffic engineering: Differentiated Services, Layer 2 VPNs/VPLS, Layer 3 VPNs/BGP MPLS, Multi Service transport for Ethernet/Frame/ATM.

## Generalized MPLS (G-MPLS)

G-MPLS initial goal was to facilitate the required interaction between the IP and optical domains by extending MPLS traffic engineering for optical networks. Now, G-MPLS aims to create a universal control plane for dynamic provisioning and restoration of optical transport networks and will be key for the architecture of future core optical networks evolving towards meshes of DWDM transport systems connecting Optical and Photonic Switches (OXC/PXC).

## The Communication Industry

The communication industry is moving to an horizontal integration like the computing industry did in the early 90s. The impact of the 1996 Telecom Act and the Internet are causing a destruction of the overall market value of the industry. Traditional Telecom Services are competing with the Internet, and Wireline Services are competing with Wireless Services.

## The Internet Security and Intrusion Detection System Markets

Although corporations agree that Internet security should be one of the enabling technologies for the business use of the Net, the market has still not taken off. Why? What are the market dynamics in Intrusion Detection, the latest Internet security market segment after the explosion of the firewall market?
